/*
  In this example, the Arduino simulates the sampling of a sinusoidal 1000 Hz
  signal with an amplitude of 100, sampled at 5000 Hz. Samples are stored
  inside the vReal array. The samples are windowed according to Hamming
  function. The FFT is computed using the windowed samples. Then the magnitudes
  of each of the frequencies that compose the signal are calculated. Finally,
  the frequency with the highest peak is obtained, being that the main frequency
  present in the signal.
